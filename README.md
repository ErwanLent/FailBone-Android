FailBone-Android
================

A fun app made at a miniature hackathon.

----------------------------------------

No matter how good looking or how cool you are, you still fail from time to time. It's ok. Actually, it's good. It means you're human. FailBone celebrates our failures by providing an intimate soundtrack for you and your friends' most epic failures. 

With one tap you can announce a failure and EVERYONE nearby will get your resounding push notification. 

So the next time you see a hipster trip over his vintage Nike's or witness an old man get hit in the groin, use FailBone to celebrate this little piece of history.
